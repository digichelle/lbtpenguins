# LB&T Penguins Website Mockup

5 February 2025

Hello, Penguins!

At long last, we’re building our own website, to replace what we lost when we declared our independence from NaNoWriMo. While that was undoubtedly the right move, we lost the tools and resources they provided—an official events calendar, forums, and a project tracker, among other things.

This is no small undertaking. We’re building all of this _from scratch_. What you’re seeing now is a work-in-progress mockup, where we’re experimenting and exploring options. Nothing is set in stone. Nothing is guaranteed. Everything is subject to change. And when it goes live, it will only be with a subset of the functionality we envision.

We welcome whatever feedback and assistance you’re able to provide—especially if you’re a professional web developer. Please note that this is an all-volunteer operation. No one is getting paid here, including me.

Thank you for sticking with us. We hope to have more to share in the near future!

Sleeves rolled up, ready to go,

Michelle
