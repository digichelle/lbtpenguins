# LB&T Penguins Website

Hello, Penguins!

At long last, we’re building our own website, to replace what we lost when we declared our independence from NaNoWriMo. While that was undoubtedly the right move, we lost the tools and resources they provided—an official events calendar, forums, and a project tracker, among other things.

This is no small undertaking. We’re building all of this _from scratch_. It will take some time before any of this is ready to see the light of day. But we’re not going to leave you in the dark regarding progress. You’ll receive regular status updates, and you can track our progress by watching this repository.

If you happen to be a professional web developer, we welcome whatever feedback and assistance you’re able to provide. Please note that this is an all-volunteer operation. No one is getting paid here, including me.

Thank you for sticking with us. We hope to have more to share in the near future!

Sleeves rolled up, ready to go,

Michelle
